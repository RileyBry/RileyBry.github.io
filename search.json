    "section": "",
    "text": "The cover athlete curse has been a well-known phenomenon for decades now. It’s most commonly associated with the NFL and its flagship game Madden, having strong claims originating back to 2002 and 2004 with the injury-plagued seasons of Dante Culpepper and Michael Vick. But does the curse go outside of football?\nWhat about baseball?\nBaseball has been in the United States longer than Colorado has been a state. But yet, America’s pastime does not escape video game superstition.\nTo analyze the effects that the cover athlete curse has on the MLB, it’s crucial to place the athletes on a common denominator that equally favors slap hitters and power hitters, catchers and shortstops, and the list goes on. In baseball, as simple as it gets, this statistic is Wins Above Replacement (WAR). This measures how many more wins an athlete contributes to a team compared to that of a replacement-level player.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nlogs &lt;- read_csv(\"mlb_hitter_value_2009_2024 (4).csv\")\nfixedlogs &lt;- logs |&gt;

However, we see this feat accomplished numerous times, most notably by Andrew McCutchen having his MVP campaign during his cover season.\nBut the collapse seen by Mauer and Puig is not a subtle regression justified by not being able to repeat their previous achievements; it was a catastrophic crash.\nNow the curse hit Mauer and Puig in two different ways. Firstly, the injury bug plagued Mauer and Puig for around 80 games for each player, Mauer missing 80 games and Puig missing 83. But even considering their injuries that kept them in the dugout for half the season, when they were on the field, their production was far behind that of their cover campaign. Puig’s 1.1 WAR in 79 games leaves him well off track to compete with his 2014 season, where he managed a 4.9 WAR in 148 games. In Mauer’s case, he only mustered up 1.5 WAR in 82 appearances, which also leaves him trailing in the dust when matched against his 5.9 WAR in 137 games the year prior.\nEven excluding the injuries, Mauer and Puig both saw major dips in their productivity while under the curse.\n\n\nCode\ntotalWAR &lt;- barchart |&gt; \n  group_by(season) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    totWAR = sum(WAR)\n    )|&gt; \n      mutate(\n        avgtotWAR = totWAR/12\n      )\nline1 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=3.218367, color=\"red3\") +\n  geom_line(data=DPuig, aes(x=season, y=WAR, group=Player), color=\"gray41\") +\n  geom_point(data=DPuig, aes(x=season, y=WAR), color=\"gray41\") +\n  geom_point(data=EPuig, aes(x=season, y=WAR), color=\"dodgerblue3\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2015.6, y=3.45, label=\"Average WAR\"), color=\"red3\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2015.7, y=0.85, label=\"Cover Season\"), color=\"dodgerblue3\", size=3) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,6), breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Yasiel Puig\", \n    y=\"Wins Above Replacement\") + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nline2 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=3.218367, color=\"red3\") +\n  geom_line(data=BMauer, aes(x=season, y=WAR, group=Player), color=\"gray41\") +\n  geom_point(data=BMauer, aes(x=season, y=WAR), color=\"gray41\") +\n  geom_point(data=EMauer, aes(x=season, y=WAR), color=\"dodgerblue3\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2012.7, y=2.98, label=\"Average WAR\"), color=\"red3\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2011.85, y=1.4, label=\"Cover Season\"), color=\"dodgerblue3\", size=3) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,6), breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Joe Mauer\", \n    y=\"Wins Above Replacement\") + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nline2 + line1 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title=\"Recovering from stardom\", \n    subtitle = \"Puig and Mauer had similar responses after their cover season collapse.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | By Riley Bry\"\n    ) &\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, the effects of the curse are seen plainly by the recovery that both Mauer and Puig saw. While it took Puig an extra season to break the spell, both athletes found their old selves, or at least what was left of their old selves, after their second season following their cover year.\nDespite what the baseball old-heads would like to say, denying any video game superstition would be ignoring the trends of the past 12 seasons. While athletes are able to overcome the curse, there’s evidence that a regression occurs, in some cases, major collapses, like that of Mauer and Puig.\nBaseball is not free from the cover athlete curse and still claims victims to this day. Now, as three new young stars, Paul Skenes, Gunner Henderson, and Elly De La Cruz, take the cover athlete title, all eyes will be watching how their young careers are affected by the infamous cover athlete curse."

In each respective sport, there’s no denying the excitement that is produced from the best teams vying for one spot at the end of the road.\nAlong that journey to hoist championship hardware, there are performances from players and teams that give the word rarity meaning. Insert one of the greatest records in playoff history: The 18-game straight playoff losing streak of the Minnesota Twins.\nThe 19-year streak of playoff atrocities breaks the concept of reasonable chance and sheds a glimpse into the misfortune of Minnesota sports fans.\nTo showcase the statistical embarrassment of this feat, in 100,000 simulations, using the Twins’ regular season win percentage, not one simulation did the Minnesota Twins lose 18 straight games. Not one.\nThe drought started all the way back in 2004 when the Twins tasted their last lick of happiness, taking down the Yankees in game one, backed by a seven-inning shutout from Johan Santana.\nWhat preceded this win was a collapse on numerous levels.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggnewscale)\n\nplayoffs_batters &lt;- read_csv(\"mlb_postseason_batting_2000_2024.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate_at(2:29, as.numeric) |&gt;\n  mutate(team = case_when(\n    team == \"Cleveland Indians\" ~ \"Cleveland Guardians\",\n    team == \"Florida Marlins\" ~ \"Miami Marlins\",\n    team == \"Anaheim Angels\" ~ \"Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim\",\n    TRUE ~ team\n  ))\n\nplayoffs_pitchers &lt;- read_csv(\"mlb_postseason_pitching_2000_2024.csv\")  |&gt;\n  mutate_at(2:28, as.numeric) |&gt;\n  mutate(team = case_when(\n    team == \"Cleveland Indians\" ~ \"Cleveland Guardians\",\n    team == \"Florida Marlins\" ~ \"Miami Marlins\",\n    team == \"Anaheim Angels\" ~ \"Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim\",\n    TRUE ~ team\n  ))\n\nTwins_Roster &lt;- playoffs_batters |&gt; \n  filter(team == \"Minnesota Twins\") |&gt; \n  group_by(name) |&gt; \n  mutate(xbh = x2b + x3b + hr ) |&gt; \n  filter(xbh &gt; 1,\n         h &gt; 1)\n\ngrouped_playoff_batters &lt;- playoffs_batters |&gt; \n  group_by(team) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n   runs_scored = sum(r, na.rm=TRUE),\n   total_at_bats = sum(ab, na.rm=TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(runs_scored_per_game = (runs_scored/total_at_bats)*100)\n\ngrouped_playoff_pitchers &lt;- playoffs_pitchers |&gt;\n  group_by(team) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    runs_against = sum(r, na.rm=TRUE),\n   total_innings = sum(ip, na.rm=TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(runs_allowed_per_game = (runs_against/total_innings)*10)\n\n\nhit_pitch_numbers &lt;- grouped_playoff_batters |&gt; inner_join(grouped_playoff_pitchers)\n\nMN_Twins &lt;- hit_pitch_numbers |&gt; \n  filter(team == \"Minnesota Twins\")\n\nNY_Yankees &lt;- hit_pitch_numbers |&gt; \n  filter(team == \"New York Yankees\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=hit_pitch_numbers,  aes(x=runs_scored_per_game, y=runs_allowed_per_game)) +\n  geom_point(data=MN_Twins,  aes(x=runs_scored_per_game, y=runs_allowed_per_game), color = \"red3\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=7.5, y=5.9, label=\"Minnesota Twins\"), color=\"red3\") +\n   geom_point(data=NY_Yankees,  aes(x=runs_scored_per_game, y=runs_allowed_per_game), color=\"blue3\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=11.65, y=4.65, label=\"New York Yankees\"), color=\"navyblue\") +\n   scale_x_continuous(limits = c(6,16), breaks = c(7,9,11,13,15)) +\n  annotate(\"rect\", fill = \"blue\", alpha = 0.1, \n        xmin = -Inf, xmax = 10,\n        ymin = Inf, ymax = 5)+\n  geom_text(aes(x=7.7, y=5.5, label=\"Bad Team zone\"), size=3.5) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Average Runs Scored per 100 At-Bats\", \n    y= \"Earned Run Average\", \n    title=\"Minnesota was the worst of the best\", \n    subtitle=\"On both sides of the ball, during the playoffs the Twins were as abysmal as it gets.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | By Riley Bry\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s pretty well understood that in baseball, to win games, you need to score more than the other team. During the Twins’ streak, they were in company of their own when compared to the other 30 teams during this 19-year span.\nOver the 18 games, the Twins gave up almost six runs a game from the bump, ranking worst in the league. At the same time, they mustered up the third-worst run production.\nHowever, the heartbreak goes deeper than an inability to score and prevent runs. For the Twins, it comes down to when the runs were scored. Over the 18 games, Minnesota was outscored in the seventh inning 23-1, leading to numerous instances of late-game torment that squelched the hope of ending the streak.\n\n\nCode\ntwins_innings_data &lt;- read_csv(\"inningdata.csv\")\n\ninning_data &lt;- twins_innings_data |&gt; \n  filter(team ==\"Twins\") |&gt; \ngroup_by(team, inning) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n   runs_scored = sum(runs),\n   runs_against = sum(runsagainst)\n  )\n\nlong_inning_data &lt;- inning_data |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"runs\"), names_to = \"Type\", values_to = \"Runs\"\n  )\n\nseventh_inning &lt;- long_inning_data |&gt; \n  filter(inning == \"7\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=long_inning_data, aes(fill=Type, y=Runs, x=inning), position=\"dodge\", stat=\"identity\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"grey40\", \"grey66\")) +\n  new_scale_fill() +\n   geom_bar(data=seventh_inning, aes(fill=Type, y=Runs, x=inning), position=\"dodge\", stat=\"identity\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,10), breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"steelblue\", \"red3\")) +\n  \n  labs(\n    x=\"Inning\", \n    y=\"Runs Scored\",\n    title=\"Seventh inning stretch the losing streak\", \n    subtitle=\"During &lt;span style = 'color:red3;'&gt;Minnesota's&lt;/span&gt; win drought their &lt;span style = 'color:steelblue;'&gt;opponents&lt;/span&gt; outscored them 23-1 in the seventh frame.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | By Riley Bry\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding insult to an already mutilated body, one of the only two innings in which the Twins in total outscored their opponents was the first inning of play. Meaning, to spell it out, the Twins found some of their most success in the first frame, and in turn, gluing Twins fans to their TV sets before brutally reminding them that they live in the land of 10,000 disappointments.\nA major part in winning games in any sport, and specifically in postseason play, is the breakout performances from an organization’s stars. That’s where the issues start for the Twins. When the time came for their flagship players to will their team to a win, they disappeared. Any consistency seen from the Minnesota staples, including José Berríos, Nelson Cruz, and Joe Nathan, vanished when October hit.\n\n\nCode\ngrouped_players &lt;- playoffs_batters |&gt; \n  group_by(name, team) |&gt; \n  mutate(xbh = x2b + x3b + hr ) |&gt; \n  filter(xbh &gt; 1,\n         h &gt; 1) |&gt; \n  filter(name != \"Totals\") |&gt; \n  mutate(name=gsub(\"#\", \"\", name)) |&gt; \n  mutate(name=gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", name))\n\navg_players &lt;- grouped_players |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_h = sum(h),\n    total_bb = sum(bb),\n    total_ab = sum(ab)\n  )\n  \ntotal_grouped_players &lt;- avg_players |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    total_obp=(total_h+total_bb)/total_ab\n  )\n\ntwins_hitters &lt;- grouped_players |&gt; \n  filter(team == \"Minnesota Twins\")\n\ngrouped_pitchers &lt;- playoffs_pitchers |&gt; \n  group_by(name, team) |&gt; \n  filter(ip &gt; 5) |&gt; \n  filter(name != \"Totals\") |&gt; \n  mutate(name=gsub(\"#\", \"\", name)) |&gt; \n  mutate(name=gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", name))\n\navg_pitchers &lt;- grouped_pitchers |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_e_runs = sum(er),\n    total_walks = sum(bb),\n    total_hits = sum(h),\n    total_ip = sum(ip)\n  )\n\ntotal_grouped_pitchers &lt;- avg_pitchers |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    total_whip=(total_hits+total_walks)/total_ip,\n    total_era=(total_e_runs/total_ip)*10\n  )\n\ntwins_pitchers &lt;- total_grouped_pitchers |&gt; \n  filter(team == \"Minnesota Twins\")\n\nplot2 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=grouped_players, aes(x=slg, y=obp, size=xbh), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=twins_hitters, aes(x=slg, y=obp, size=xbh), color=\"dodgerblue4\") +\n  scale_size_continuous(name=\"Extra Base Hits\") +\n  annotate(\"rect\", fill = \"red\", alpha = 0.2, \n        xmin = -Inf, xmax = .6,\n        ymin = -Inf, ymax = .35)+\n  geom_text(aes(x=.32, y=.2, label=\"Bad Player zone\"), size=3.5) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Slugging Percentage\", \n    y=\"On Base Percentage\",\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nplot1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=total_grouped_pitchers, aes(x=total_whip, y=total_era, size=total_ip), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=twins_pitchers, aes(x=total_whip, y=total_era, size=total_ip), color=\"dodgerblue4\") +\n  scale_size_continuous(name=\"Innings Pitched\") +\n  annotate(\"rect\", fill = \"green\", alpha = 0.2, \n        xmin = -Inf, xmax = .8,\n        ymin = -Inf, ymax = 3.5)+\n  geom_text(aes(x=.3, y=1.5, label=\"Good Player zone\"), size=3.5) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"WHIP\", \n    y=\"Earned Run Average\",\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nplot1 / plot2 +\n   plot_annotation(\n    title=\"No heroics from Minnesota's headliners\", \n    subtitle = \"For both hitting and pitching the Twins didn't see a single player breakout during their postseason skid.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | By Riley Bry\"\n    ) &\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut then a savior arrived.
