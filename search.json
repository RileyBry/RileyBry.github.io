    "text": "The cover athlete curse has been a well-known phenomenon for decades now. It’s most commonly associated with the NFL and its flagship game Madden, having strong claims originating back to 2002 and 2004 with the injury-plagued seasons of Dante Culpepper and Michael Vick. But does the curse go outside of football?\nWhat about baseball?\nBaseball has been in the United States longer than Colorado has been a state. But yet, America’s pastime does not escape video game superstition.\nTo analyze the effects that the cover athlete curse has on the MLB, it’s crucial to place the athletes on a common denominator that equally favors slap hitters and power hitters, catchers and shortstops, and the list goes on. In baseball, as simple as it gets, this statistic is Wins Above Replacement (WAR). This measures how many more wins an athlete contributes to a team compared to that of a replacement-level player.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nlogs &lt;- read_csv(\"mlb_hitter_value_2009_2024 (4).csv\")\nfixedlogs &lt;- logs |&gt;

However, we see this feat accomplished numerous times, most notably by Andrew McCutchen having his MVP campaign during his cover season.\nBut the collapse seen by Mauer and Puig is not a subtle regression justified by not being able to repeat their previous achievements; it was a catastrophic crash.\nNow the curse hit Mauer and Puig in two different ways. Firstly, the injury bug plagued Mauer and Puig for around 80 games for each player, Mauer missing 80 games and Puig missing 83. But even considering their injuries that kept them in the dugout for half the season, when they were on the field, their production was far behind that of their cover campaign. Puig’s 1.1 WAR in 79 games leaves him well off track to compete with his 2014 season, where he managed a 4.9 WAR in 148 games. In Mauer’s case, he only mustered up 1.5 WAR in 82 appearances, which also leaves him trailing in the dust when matched against his 5.9 WAR in 137 games the year prior.\nEven excluding the injuries, Mauer and Puig both saw major dips in their productivity while under the curse.\n\n\nCode\ntotalWAR &lt;- barchart |&gt; \n  group_by(season) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    totWAR = sum(WAR)\n    )|&gt; \n      mutate(\n        avgtotWAR = totWAR/12\n      )\nline1 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=3.218367, color=\"red3\") +\n  geom_line(data=DPuig, aes(x=season, y=WAR, group=Player), color=\"gray41\") +\n  geom_point(data=DPuig, aes(x=season, y=WAR), color=\"gray41\") +\n  geom_point(data=EPuig, aes(x=season, y=WAR), color=\"dodgerblue3\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2015.6, y=3.45, label=\"Average WAR\"), color=\"red3\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2015.7, y=0.85, label=\"Cover Season\"), color=\"dodgerblue3\", size=3) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,6), breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Yasiel Puig\", \n    y=\"Wins Above Replacement\") + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nline2 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=3.218367, color=\"red3\") +\n  geom_line(data=BMauer, aes(x=season, y=WAR, group=Player), color=\"gray41\") +\n  geom_point(data=BMauer, aes(x=season, y=WAR), color=\"gray41\") +\n  geom_point(data=EMauer, aes(x=season, y=WAR), color=\"dodgerblue3\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2012.7, y=2.98, label=\"Average WAR\"), color=\"red3\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2011.85, y=1.4, label=\"Cover Season\"), color=\"dodgerblue3\", size=3) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,6), breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Joe Mauer\", \n    y=\"Wins Above Replacement\") + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nline2 + line1 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title=\"Recovering from stardom\", \n    subtitle = \"Puig and Mauer had similar responses after their cover season collapse.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | By Riley Bry\"\n    ) &\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, the effects of the curse are seen plainly by the recovery that both Mauer and Puig saw. While it took Puig an extra season to break the spell, both athletes found their old selves, or at least what was left of their old selves, after their second season following their cover year.\nDespite what the baseball old-heads would like to say, denying any video game superstition would be ignoring the trends of the past 12 seasons. While athletes are able to overcome the curse, there’s evidence that a regression occurs, in some cases, major collapses, like that of Mauer and Puig.\nBaseball is not free from the cover athlete curse and still claims victims to this day. Now, as three new young stars, Paul Skenes, Gunner Henderson, and Elly De La Cruz, take the cover athlete title, all eyes will be watching how their young careers are affected by the infamous cover athlete curse."
